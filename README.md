# Obsidian GLSL Canvas

This is a port of [GLSL Canvas](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslCanvas) to obsidian, allowing you to keep (your) shader code and your notes side by side!

To use it, simply make a codeblock with `glsl_render` as the language and start messing around.
- an example of how to write a shader with GLSL Canvas' uniforms and functions can be found [here](https://thebookofshaders.com/edit.php)

Please note that this plugin is still in development and might cause unexpected behaviors/crashes, so please save your work before using it.

## Installation
You can use the obsidian BRAT plugin to install this plugin.
